# BMI Calculator

BMI Calculator is a simple Python tool that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's height and weight. The application also provides an interpretation of the BMI result, whether it indicates underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.


## How it works

- User Input: The user inputs their weight (in kg) and height (in meters).
- BMI Calculation: The BMI is calculated using the formula:
    ```bash
         BMI = weight / (height ** 2)
    ```
    - Result Interpretation: Based on the calculated BMI, the program will categorize the result into one of the following:
        - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
        - Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
        - Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
        - Obesity: BMI >= 30

## Results

- Output: The application provides the calculated BMI value and categorizes it according to health standards.
- Interpretation: Helps users understand whether their weight is within the healthy range.
